# So-long
It's Time to create a 2D Game >> :)
Itâ€™s time for you to create a basic computer graphics project!
so long will help you improve your skills in the following areas: window management,
event handling, colors, textures, and so forth.
You are going to use the school graphical library: the MiniLibX! This library was
developed internally and includes basic necessary tools to open a window, create images
and deal with keyboard and mouse events.
The other goals are similar to every other goal for this first year: being rigorous, level
up in C programming, use basic algorithms, do some information research, and so forth.
